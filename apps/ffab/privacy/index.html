    <p>
        The details you enter into this app are stored in an online cloud database "Firebase" that is managed by Northumbria University (the data controller). The database is provided by Google (a data processor).
    </p>
    <p>
        An email address is required to register with this app. Your email address will not be shared and will not be used for any other purpose beyond this app. You are asked to sign in using an email address so that: 1. We can provide user support via email; 2. We can send a password reset email if necessary; 3. We can identify if an app user is a participant within the Football Fans and Betting research project.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app allows you to enter financial and other information relating to gambling. This data will not be shared and will not be used for any other purpose beyond this app. The information is needed for the functionality and purpose of the app (keeping track in a diary).
    </p>
    <p>
        Only the app developers at Northumbria University have access to the database. Passwords are securely encrypted and your account is not linked to any other account you may have (for example, it is not linked to a Google account). Data will not be directly shared with other parties but aggregated summary statistics will be produced and made available for research purposes. If you are a participant in the Football Fans and Betting research project you may be asked if you used this app and you may be asked which email address you used with the app so that we can differentiate research participants from non-participants.
    </p>

        This app has been developed as part of research led by Professor Gerda Reith and her team based at the University of Glasgow. The study is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR 127665). This project has been approved by the University of Glasgowâ€™s College of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data entered into the app will not be stored beyond the duration of the research project. Data can be deleted upon request (contact john.rooksby@northumbria.ac.uk).
