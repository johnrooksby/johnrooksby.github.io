              How to Install The Aware Client
            </div>


            <div class="card-body bg-light">

              <p class="card-text">
                You are being asked to install an app called The Aware Client. This app is made by researchers at the Univesrity of Oulu in Finland. We are using it in our study to collect data. The data is collected to our own server and is not seen by the creators of the app. The app will run in the background on your device and log data to our server. 
              </p>

            	<h3>Step 1: Install the Aware app</h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                Installation steps are different for Android and iOS.
              </p>

           		<h5>AWARE for Android</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
              	The following steps should be taken for downloading on Android:

              	<ol>
              		<li>
              			Download the app from this website by selecting the link below
		                <br><br>
		                <a href = "http://johnrooksby.org/projects/ppha/aware-phone-release.apk">Download the app for Android</a> (File size: 7.5mb)
		                <br><br>
            		</li>
            		<li>
		                To install the app you will need to download it and then tap on the download to 'open' it. 
		            </li>
		            <li>
		                If the app does not install, you may need to have an option selected in your Android settings to "allow installation from unknown sources". On some devices, Android will show this option when you try to install. On others you will need to find this option in your device settings (it is usually in the 'security' section). Please contact me if you have trouble finding it.
		            </li>
		            <li>
		                When you install the app, it will ask you for many permissions. <b>agreeing to these does not mean we collect that data</b>. No one other than us will gather any data, and nothing other than what we specify below.
		            </li>
		            <li>
		                When you install the app you will recieve two notifications, firslty to add the app to turn of the 'battery optimisation' for the app, and secondly to turn on accessibility services for the app. Please tap on these notifications and do the requested actions.  
                	</li>
                </ol>

                It is helpful if you can install this app, but if you have any problems or uncertainties then please contact me or discuss these with me in interview. 

              </p>
				<h5>AWARE for iPhone / iOS</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Go to the Apple App Store and search "Aware client". It should be the only result. <b>When you install the app please select "always allow" as the location preference</b>, even if you do not want us to log location. This preference is necessary for keeping the app running, and does not mean anyone is collecting your location data. 
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <hr>
              <h3>Step 2: Join a "study" to start uploading data </h3>

              <p class="card-text">
                No data is uploaded until you 'join a study'. Once you have joined a study, the app will start uploading data to our secure server.
                <br><br>

                The easiest way to join a study is to scan a 2D barcode. However this means you will also need access to a computer or something else to display the code to scan. If you cannot do this, email me and I will send a link with further instructions.

                <br><br>


                 In the Aware app at the top right there is a 2D barcode icon. Tap this to open the barcode scanner. The barcodes are linked below.
              </p>

              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Option 1: Location, Battery, Screen On/Off, Apps Used</b><br><br>
                <a href="ppha/loc-bat-screen.html">See barcode for option 1</a><br><br>
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Option 2: Battery, Screen On/Off, Apps Used.</b><br><br>
                <a href="ppha/bat-screen.html">see barcode for option 2</a><br><br>
              </p>
              
              <p class="card-text">Don't like these options? Contact me and I will happily give you other choices</p>
              <p class="card-text">One <b>important option</b> to consider in the app is the "Aware Study: Study and Synch Settings" at the bottom of the main screen (just above the 'Advanced' section). You can select "Wi-Fi only: Synch only over Wi-Fi" if you wish (this option may be ticked already on your device). 
              <br><br>



              <hr>
              <h3>Step 3: Uninstalling</h3>
				<p class="card-text">You can uninstall the app when you feel you've had enough. Before you uninstall it will be helpful if you have uploaded data (this will happen if you are on WiFi and plug in your device to charge, or if you press the cloud symbol with an arrow). To uninstall on iOS please just delete the app. On Android you should delete the app and you may also remove a folder on your device called 'AWARE'. On Android you may also want to deselect the 'install from unknown sources' option. I am happy to help you with this.</p><br><br><br>

          <h3>Information About the Study</h3>

          <p>
            The <a href="http://johnrooksby.org/research/Information_Sheet_PPHA.pdf">participant information sheet for this study can be found here</a>. Information from it is summarised below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What is the study about?</b> In this study we are designing a prototype application for mobile phones that will help students track their emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, and enable the University to monitor student health and understand the relationship between health and learning. We have not yet built this application, and are starting by asking students how such an application can best be designed to meet their needs, values and concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What does the study involve?</b> We are using a ‘participatory design’ approach in this study. We will engage with approximately 20 students to ask them about their opinions on everyday wellbeing at University, the role of the University in caring for student health, and the acceptability of data collection from mobile devices. We will present design prototypes and ask for feedback. We will also ask participants to install a prototype logging application that will collect data from their device for us to present back to and discuss with participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Do I have to take part, and can I withdraw from the study?</b> You do not have to take part, and you may withdraw from the study at any time without having to give a reason and without your rights being affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Can anyone participate?</b> Not everyone that wants to participate will be able to. We have limited space and are trying to meet criteria such as gender balance. You must also meet the following criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must be a student (including postgrads) at the University of Edinburgh</li>
              <li>You must be over 16 years of age</li>
              <li>You must have an Android or iOS mobile device that you use on a day-to-day basis as your main device</li>
              <li>Your mobile device must have an up to date version of Android or iOS.</li>
              <li>You should not regularly let children or vulnerable people use your device</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a student in Design Informatics where this study is taking place, please carefully consider whether you are comfortable to participate. You will not gain any advantage or disadvantage for your course from participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What will I need to do?</b> We will ask you to attend three sessions that will last for 2 hours each. The sessions will be in small or medium groups, and in some cases on a one-to-one basis. The workshops will be held at the University of Edinburgh. We will also ask you to install an app on your mobile phone that will collect some data and store this on a server.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Will my privacy be protected?</b> We will not reveal to anyone that you have taken part, and we will anonymise  the data we collect. You should be aware that the research involves small group workshops and therefore your participation and contribution will be known to some other participants. Because we will be collecting data from your mobile phone, which can reveal many details about your life (e.g. where you go, when you are awake), you should also consider that there are privacy risks in this study. You should also consider that information relating to your mental health may be revealed to us and other workshop participants. We will not collect or retain data that you are uncomfortable with.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What data will be collected and what will happen to this?</b> We will collect audio data from the workshops using an audio recorder, which will then be transcribed. We may also collect paper materials such as notes, and may take photographs during the workshops (typically of artifacts produced rather than people). Names and other readily identifying information will be removed from the transcripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the mobile phone data collection, we will ask you for permission to collect a range of sensor data and use in-app features such as a questionnaire. You will have control over what data is collected and you will be able to request that data is deleted. The data will be managed by the researchers and not shared within the broader University.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to publish data from this study on an open repository making it available to other researchers for use in their own work. All the data we publish will be anonymous. We will provide you with information about what data we seek to publish, what risks there are, and you will have control over what can and cannot be put in a repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b> Yes, you will receive a £50 voucher for Amazon.co.uk. You will receive this upon participation in the final workshop. Choices you make and data you contribute during the study will not affect payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What are the possible risks/disadvantages of taking part?</b> Some of the items discussed as part of the study relate to mental health and wellbeing. The researchers are not able to provide health advice, however information about where to get help and advice is available on the extra sheet included with the Participant Information Sheet, entitled “Mental Health”.
