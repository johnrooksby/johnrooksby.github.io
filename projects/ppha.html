          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            The Prototyping Population Health Analytics (PPHA) project is a Challenge Investment Fund project in the College of Art at the Univeristy of Edinburgh. The research is being conducted by John Rooksby under the supervision of Dave Murray-Rust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project has ethical approval from the College of Arts Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.
          </p>

          <h3>Particpants Required</h3>
          <p>
            We are seeking undergraduate and postgraduate students to participate in this study. Participants will be asked to attend three sessions that will last approximately 2 hours. They will also be asked to install an app on their phone which collects data. Participants will receive a £50 Amazon voucher. Use <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYWodh04tJs1LnLMHH7HocK1UMlhPMUFTT1gzVUEzMDZYVUJSVktSRDJCRi4u">this link to apply</a>, or use the button below.

          <h3>Information About the Study</h3>

          <p>
            The <a href="http://johnrooksby.org/research/Information_Sheet_PPHA.pdf">participant information sheet for this study can be found here</a>. Information from it is summarised below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What is the study about?</b> In this study we are designing a prototype application for mobile phones that will help students track their emotional, mental and physical wellbeing, and enable the University to monitor student health and understand the relationship between health and learning. We have not yet built this application, and are starting by asking students how such an application can best be designed to meet their needs, values and concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What does the study involve?</b> We are using a ‘participatory design’ approach in this study. We will engage with approximately 20 students to ask them about their opinions on everyday wellbeing at University, the role of the University in caring for student health, and the acceptability of data collection from mobile devices. We will present design prototypes and ask for feedback. We will also ask participants to install a prototype logging application that will collect data from their device for us to present back to and discuss with participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Do I have to take part, and can I withdraw from the study?</b> You do not have to take part, and you may withdraw from the study at any time without having to give a reason and without your rights being affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Can anyone participate?</b> Not everyone that wants to participate will be able to. We have limited space and are trying to meet criteria such as gender balance. You must also meet the following criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must be a student (including postgrads) at the University of Edinburgh</li>
              <li>You must be over 16 years of age</li>
              <li>You must have an Android or iOS mobile device that you use on a day-to-day basis as your main device</li>
              <li>Your mobile device must have an up to date version of Android or iOS.</li>
              <li>You should not regularly let children or vulnerable people use your device</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a student in Design Informatics where this study is taking place, please carefully consider whether you are comfortable to participate. You will not gain any advantage or disadvantage for your course from participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What will I need to do?</b> We will ask you to attend three sessions that will last for 2 hours each. The sessions will be in small or medium groups, and in some cases on a one-to-one basis. The workshops will be held at the University of Edinburgh. We will also ask you to install an app on your mobile phone that will collect some data and store this on a server.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Will my privacy be protected?</b> We will not reveal to anyone that you have taken part, and we will anonymise  the data we collect. You should be aware that the research involves small group workshops and therefore your participation and contribution will be known to some other participants. Because we will be collecting data from your mobile phone, which can reveal many details about your life (e.g. where you go, when you are awake), you should also consider that there are privacy risks in this study. You should also consider that information relating to your mental health may be revealed to us and other workshop participants. We will not collect or retain data that you are uncomfortable with.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What data will be collected and what will happen to this?</b> We will collect audio data from the workshops using an audio recorder, which will then be transcribed. We may also collect paper materials such as notes, and may take photographs during the workshops (typically of artifacts produced rather than people). Names and other readily identifying information will be removed from the transcripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the mobile phone data collection, we will ask you for permission to collect a range of sensor data and use in-app features such as a questionnaire. You will have control over what data is collected and you will be able to request that data is deleted. The data will be managed by the researchers and not shared within the broader University.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to publish data from this study on an open repository making it available to other researchers for use in their own work. All the data we publish will be anonymous. We will provide you with information about what data we seek to publish, what risks there are, and you will have control over what can and cannot be put in a repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b> Yes, you will receive a £50 voucher for Amazon.co.uk. You will receive this upon participation in the final workshop. Choices you make and data you contribute during the study will not affect payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>What are the possible risks/disadvantages of taking part?</b> Some of the items discussed as part of the study relate to mental health and wellbeing. The researchers are not able to provide health advice, however information about where to get help and advice is available on the extra sheet included with the Participant Information Sheet, entitled “Mental Health”.
