					 "abstract" : "This one-day workshop will encourage the emergence of more critical and socially oriented perspectives to a data-driven life. We adopt a focus on how data mediates relationships – personal, professional, across social networks and cross-culturally – to consider the social and cultural implications of quantified lifestyles. At the workshop, attendees will engage in panel discussions, and a series of ‘speed-dates’ to develop a catalogue of compelling relationships with data, which exemplify the social nature of personal informatics tools, and the opportunities and challenges for design.",

					 "abstract" : "We have implemented a blockchain system based on Ethereum for use by a university to store student grades and to provide a cryptocurrency. Based upon an exploratory, qualitative evaluation we have found several tensions between the concept of a university as an organisation, and the concept of distributed autonomous organisations (DAOs) in Ethereum. These include tensions in (i) mechanisms of trust, (ii) boundaries of openness, (iii) values in procedures. In this paper we outline our implementation and the evaluation process."

					 "abstract" : "Rosacea is a chronic skin condition with multiple signs and symptoms, but typically associated with reddening of the face. Sufferers usually want to avoid and reduce flare-ups of the condition, and so will try to identify and limit possible triggers. In this paper we report an investigation into technology for managing rosacea, particularly for identifying and tracking triggers. Our study has included: a survey of the existing technology; a survey of the attitudes and opinions of people with rosacea on technology; and finally, the production and evaluation of a prototype for identifying triggers. This work is investigatory and so our formative evaluation and discussion focus on understanding the problem space and establishing directions for future development work.",

 					 "abstract" : "This paper summarizes and discusses findings about personal tracking and social relationships from three studies. All three studies were interview based, one where people were interviewed about their general use of trackers and two where they were interviewed about novel prototypes. None of the studies were specifically about social relationships. Yet, the details of people’s everyday relationships pervaded the findings about what, how and why tracking is done. In this paper I put forward the notion that tracking is enmeshed in relationships: that the ways in which tracking is done is contingent on people’s everyday social relationships. This can be true irrespectively of what social features a tracker has or what the user is trying to achieve with the tracker."

These challenges are based on experiences in the creation and evaluation of apps for self-monitoring and behaviour change."
